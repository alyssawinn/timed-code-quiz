# Timed Code Quiz

## Description
A quiz to test your knowledge of fundamental JavaScript. Try to beat the clock and your competitors (who must take the quiz on this same computer and browser of course!). If you are good enough, you may even make the highscore board! But don't worry...you can clear the high scores and come out on top on the next go-around!
